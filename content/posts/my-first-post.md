Who is Savitribai Phule ?

She is considered to be the modern India's first women teacher. She has founded the first women's school in India at Pune in 1948.

Savitribai was married off to activist and social-reformer Jyotirao Phule, at a very young age. But with her husbandâ€™s support and motivation, she learned to read and write. As female education was not given importance that time, people were not in favour of her running a school for girls. To discourage her, people threw cow dung and mud at her while she walks towards the school. But even after bearing such atrocities, she was never deterred by failure and carried two sarees. Later on, she also built 18 such schools in the Pune region.

Google also celebrated her birthday through Doodle.
